At the time of this writing, two major versions of Sublime Text exist: Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3. Generally speaking, Sublime Text 3 is the better choice. Even though it’s technically in beta, it’s as stable as Sublime Text 2 and has more features.

Use Sublime Text 2 only if you have found issues running Sublime Text 3 or you depend on any package not available for Sublime Text 3.

Getting Sublime Text 3
Sublime Text 3 currently has two release channels:

Beta (default, recommended)
Dev
Beta releases are better tested and more reliable for everyday use than development builds. The majority of users should only use beta releases.

The dev channel is unstable: dev builds may contain bugs and not work reliably. Dev builds are updated more often than beta releases.

Dev builds are only available to registered users.
