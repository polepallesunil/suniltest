At the time of this writing, two major versions of Sublime Text exist: Sublime Text 2 and Sublime Text 3. Generally speaking, Sublime Text 3 is the better choice. Even though it’s technically in beta, it’s as stable as Sublime Text 2 and has more features.

Use Sublime Text 2 only if you have found issues running Sublime Text 3 or you depend on any package not available for Sublime Text 3.
